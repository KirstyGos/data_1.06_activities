# 1.06 Activity 1

### Debate

1. What is the difference between a normal distribution and standard normal distribution?
2. Go through the documentation on [uniform distribution](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.uniform.html).
3. Discuss the use of uniform distribution in generating random numbers.

### Code

4. Plot a uniform distribution - [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.rand.html#numpy.random.rand).



1. All normal distributions, like the standard normal distribution, are unimodal and symmetrically distributed with    a bell-shaped curve. However, a normal distribution can take on any value as its mean and standard deviation. In    the standard normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are always fixed.
